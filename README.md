# Bible Word and Phrase Counter

This project contains a Python script that parses an HTML file of the Bible and creates a treemap visualization of the most common words and phrases.

## The phrase can be improve with ML:
  Hereâ€™s a high-level idea of how this could be done:

  - Preprocess the text: This could involve cleaning the text, removing stop words, and possibly lemmatizing words.
  
  - Convert sentences into vectors: Use an NLP model to convert each sentence into a vector. This could be a simple Bag-of-Words model, TF-IDF, or more complex models like Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT, etc.
  
  - Calculate similarity: For each sentence, calculate its similarity to all other sentences. This could be done using cosine similarity, which is a common measure for the similarity between vectors.
  
  - Group sentences: Based on their similarities, group sentences together. This could be done using a clustering algorithm like K-means.
  
  - Count groups: Instead of counting identical sentences, count the number of sentences in each group.

## Getting Started
